# Residential Autonomous Air Ventilation Control (RAAVC)

## Project Overview
The **Residential Autonomous Air Ventilation Control (RAAVC)** project is designed to optimize airflow in residential spaces using custom motorized 3D-printed air vent covers and wall-mounted sensors (temperature, humidity, and occupancy). Paired with Google Nest, the system dynamically adjusts air distribution based on local conditions, aiming to improve efficiency by reducing HVAC runtime, saving energy, and lowering costs. The system will also utilize machine learning to enhance control over time, offering better climate control in homes by directing air where it's needed most.

## Motivation
Inspired by the climate control challenges of a split-level home, the **Residential Autonomous Air Ventilation Control (RAAVC)** system was designed to address the heating and cooling imbalances commonly faced in multi-story living spaces. The system was created to optimize airflow by mechanically controlling air vent openings and closings based on real-time conditions in each room. This targeted airflow management counters issues like air sinkage, uneven temperature distribution, and inefficient HVAC use, ultimately improving comfort and energy efficiency throughout the home.

## Problem and Solution
**Problem:** In split-level and long ranch-style homes, effectively managing temperature across different floors and spaces presents significant challenges. In split-level homes, the basement often remains too cold in summer while the top floor bedrooms can become overheated, leading to discomfort and inefficient HVAC operation. Similarly, in ranch homes, southern spaces (in the northern hemisphere) can become excessively hot while more centralized locations housing the thermostat, such as a living room or foyer, may indicate a satisfied temperature threshold.
**Solution:** The **Residential Autonomous Air Ventilation Control (RAAVC)** system employs custom motorized 3D-printed vent covers and wall-mounted sensors to dynamically regulate airflow based on localized temperature, humidity, and occupancy data. By adjusting vent positions in real-time, the system optimally directs climate-controlled air to where itâ€™s needed most, enhancing overall comfort and energy efficiency while reducing HVAC runtime and costs.


## Learnings
Throughout the development of the **Residential Autonomous Air Ventilation Control (RAAVC)** system, we have gained valuable insights and skills in various areas, including:
- **CAD Assembly and 3D Printing Optimization:** Learning to design and optimize components for efficient 3D printing has been crucial in creating the custom vent covers and sensor housings.
- **Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Signal Processing:** Understanding the intricacies of wireless communication has enabled effective data transfer between devices within the system.
- **Raspberry Pi GPIO Control:** Gaining proficiency in using Raspberry Pi GPIO pins has allowed us to control hardware components seamlessly.
- **Software Development:** Developing the necessary software for data collection, processing, and system control has enhanced our coding and problem-solving skills.
- **Machine Learning for System Optimization:** We are continuing to explore self-improving machine learning models to further optimize airflow management and enhance energy efficiency in HVAC operations.
