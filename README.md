# RAAVC
Residential Autonomous Air Ventilation Control (RAAVC) uses motorized 3D-printed vent covers and wall-mounted sensors (temperature, humidity, occupancy) with Google Nest integration to optimize airflow based on local conditions. It aims to reduce HVAC runtime, saving energy and costs. Data collection is ongoing, with plans for a research paper.
